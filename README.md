# Gaming Industry Analysis
----------------------------------------------
The global gaming market generated $159.3 billion in revenue in 2020, according to Tom Wijman a Newzoo senior market analyst. This is a 9.3 percent year-over-year growth. According to Newzoo, it projects that the industry will surpass $200 billion in revenue in 2023! To ensure this growth of revenue, data mining of purchasing data from the fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli was used to unearth actionable insights. As many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged by some gaming companies to purchase optional items to enhance their playing experience. To understand players purchases, Pandas (an open source Python package) was selected, since a CSV file created in Microsoft Excel could be easily imported into Pandas. Pandas was also considered a robust option for this analysis because of its suitability for data analysis via its Series and DataFrame data structures and its multiple methods for convenient data filtering.The code was created in Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web application that allowed for creation of live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Jupyter Notebook was also selected because of its powerful way to write and iterate Python code for data analysis. 

# Results

The analysis once completed generated a report that extracted hidden and meaningful insights and recommendations as to how the company could increase revenue based on demographics.
Three observable trends in the data:

1.)	Males are the dominant players of the Heroes of Pymoli.  Males total purchases are a whopping 83% ($1967) of sales compared to females and others/non-disclosed.

2.)	Demographically, males ages 20 - 23 years old play the game more and therefore spend more of all the age groups. They also have the highest total purchase price of other age groups.

3.)	Males appear to be the main users of Heroes of Pymoli going forward. However, one of the top 5 spenders is a 22 years old female (SN - Chamjask73), which falls in line demographically with the age group of 20 â€“ 23 years old who enjoy playing the game.  Observable data trends could potentially be changed by the gaming company if they began to market specifically to 22 years old females.  The most popular and profitable items share three of the same items (Final Critic, Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm, and Nirvana). These three items could specifically be marketed to females, given that the 22 years old female top spender is highly likely to have played and enjoyed these items.
