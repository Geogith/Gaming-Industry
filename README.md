# Gaming Industry Analysis

The global gaming market generated $159.3 billion in revenue in 2020, according to Tom Wijman a Newzoo senior market analyst. This is a 9.3 percent year-over-year growth. According to Newzoo, it projects that the industry will surpass $200 billion in revenue in 2023! Gaming is becoming a huge profit center. For this reason, I analyzed the data for the fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli. As many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged by some gaming companies to purchase optional items to enhance their playing experience. My analysis generates a report that extracts hidden and meaningful insights based on the game's purchasing data. It also provides recommendations as to how the company could increase revenue based on demographics.

The dataset provided was a CSV file created in Excel that required some manipulation and staging in order to use it in Pandas (an open source Python package). Pandas was select as a robust option for analysis because of its suitability for data analysis via its Series and DataFrame data structures, its multiple methods for convenient data filtering, and its variety of utilities to perform Input/Output operations in a seamless manner.  

The code was writting in Jupyter Notebook.

# Results

Three observable trends in the data:

1.)	Males are the dominant players of the Heroes of Pymoli.  Males total purchases are a whopping 83% ($1967) of sales compared to females and others/non-disclosed.

2.)	Demographically, males ages 20 - 23 years old play the game more and therefore spend more of all the age groups. They also have the highest total purchase price of other age groups.

3.)	Males appear to be the main users of Heroes of Pymoli going forward. However, one of the top 5 spenders is a 22 years old female (SN - Chamjask73), which falls in line demographically with the age group of 20 â€“ 23 years old who enjoy playing the game.  Observable data trends could potentially be changed by the gaming company if they began to market specifically to 22 years old females.  The most popular and profitable items share three of the same items (Final Critic, Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm, and Nirvana). These three items could specifically be marketed to females, given that the 22 years old female top spender is highly likely to have played and enjoyed these items.
