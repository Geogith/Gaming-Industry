Three observable trends in the data:

1.)	Males are the dominant players of the Heroes of Pymoli.  Males total purchases are a whopping 83% ($1967) of sales compared to females and others/non-disclosed.

2.)	Demographically, males ages 20 - 23 years old play the game more and therefore spend more of all the age groups. They also have the highest total purchase price of other age groups.

3.)	Males appear to be the main users of Heroes of Pymoli going forward. However, one of the top 5 spenders is a 22 years old female (SN - Chamjask73), which falls in line demographically with the age group of 20 â€“ 23 years old who enjoy playing the game.  Observable data trends could potentially be changed by the gaming company if they began to market specifically to 22 years old females.  The most popular and profitable items share three of the same items (Final Critic, Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm, and Nirvana). These three items could specifically be marketed to females, given that the 22 years old female top spender is highly likely to have played and enjoyed these items.
