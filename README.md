# Gaming Industry Analysis

The global gaming market generated $159.3 billion in revenue in 2020, according to Tom Wijman a Newzoo senior market analyst. This is a 9.3 percent year-over-year growth. According to Newzoo, it projects that the industry will surpass $200 billion in revenue in 2023! To ensure this growth of revenue, data mining of purchasing data from the fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli was used to unearth actionable insights. As many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged by some gaming companies to purchase optional items to enhance their playing experience. 

To understand players purchases, Pandas was selected, an open source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language. A CSV file created in Microsoft Excel was easily imported into Pandas for analysis. Pandas was also considered a robust option for this analysis because of its suitability for data analysis via its Series and DataFrame data structures and its multiple methods for convenient data filtering. Data filtering would be an important part of the analysis. 

Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web application, was used because it allowed a powerful way of creating iterative Python code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. This capability was also another important part of the data analysis. 

# Results

The analysis generated a report extracting actionable insights and recommendations from the data, as to how the industry could ensure future growth of revenue:
 
1.)	Males are the dominant players of Heroes of Pymoli. Males are responsible for whopping 83% of sales compared to females and others/non-disclosed.

2.)	Demographically, males ages 20 - 23 years old play the game more and therefore spend more of all the age groups. They also have the highest total purchase price of any other age groups.

3.)	In the future, males will probably be the main users of Heroes of Pymoli. However, one of the top 5 spenders is a 22 years old female (SN - Chamjask73), which falls in line demographically with the age group of 20 â€“ 23 years old who enjoy playing the game. Current purchasing trends of dominantly male users could potentially be changed by the gaming industry, if a portion of their marketing strategy began to specifically market to 22 years old females. The industry could start marketing to females the three most popular and profitable items: Final Critic, Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm, and Nirvana. These three items could specifically be marketed to females, given that the 22 years old female top spender is highly likely to have played and enjoyed these items.
